# DoS Packet Flood Simulation

This project documents a Denial-of-Service (DoS) packet flood simulation performed in a controlled laboratory environment using the Xerxes tool. The goal was to understand network-level DoS behavior and highlight the importance of defensive security controls.

## What’s Inside
- Packet flooding simulation against a lab-based target system
- Observation of network traffic patterns generated during high-volume packet bursts
- Identification of common indicators associated with DoS-style activity
- High-level recommendations for network monitoring and mitigation strategies

## Tools Used
- Xerxes
- Kali Linux
- Linux networking utilities

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how packet flooding techniques can impact service availability at the network level and reinforces the need for proactive monitoring, rate limiting, and intrusion detection mechanisms.
